flipflop-windows-wheel
======================

This is a C# dotnet4 application which controls the 'flipflopwheel' option in Windows, which allows you to specify how scrolling behavior works in Windows.  Normally, sliding your finger down on a trackpad or scrollwheel will move the scrollbar down on a page.  This setting reverses that behavior.
